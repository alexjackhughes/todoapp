# To Do App

A simple to-do app to hone my JavaScript skills, built using Meteor.

With this to-do app, you can:
- Create new tasks
- Mark tasks as finished
- Mark finished tasks as Private
- Mark unfinished tasks as Public
- Remove any task
- Filter tasks between all and tasks left to do

Here's a screenshot of what the todo app looks like:
